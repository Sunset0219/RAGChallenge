      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether Mercia Asset Management PLC mentioned any mergers or acquisitions in the annual report.\n2. The phrase 'mergers or acquisitions' refers to business combinations where the company merges with or acquires other entities, which could be discussed in various sections like strategy, investments, or financial statements.\n3. Reviewing the provided context: Page 14 mentions the company's hybrid investment model and direct investments in businesses, but does not specify mergers or acquisitions. Page 97 details investments made during the year, including sales of investments (e.g., Faradion Limited, Oxford Genetics Limited) and loan repayments, but these are disposals or realizations, not mergers or acquisitions. Page 98 lists direct investments held, indicating ongoing stakes in companies, but does not describe new mergers or acquisitions. Other pages (70, 78, 92, 69, 77, 80, 81) cover financial statements, auditor reports, share options, and accounting policies, with no mention of mergers or acquisitions.\n4. The context focuses on the company's investment activities, including making investments and selling them, but there is no explicit mention of merging with or acquiring other companies in the reported year. The term 'acquisitions' might be implied in investment activities, but the report does not detail any specific merger or acquisition events as typically understood in corporate transactions."

      "question_text": "According to the annual report, what is the Operating margin (%) for Tradition (within the last period or at the end of the last period)? If data is not available, return 'N/A'.",
      "kind": "number",
      "value": "N/A",
      "references": [],
      "reasoning_process": "1. **Metric Definition:** The question asks for 'Operating margin (%)' for 'Tradition' (presumably referring to Compagnie Financière Tradition SA or its Group) 'within the last period or at the end of the last period.' Operating margin is typically calculated as operating profit divided by revenue, expressed as a percentage. The 'last period' likely refers to the fiscal year 2022, as the context includes data for 2022 and 2021.\n2. **Context Examination:** The provided context includes various pages from the annual report, such as notes to the consolidated financial statements, segment information, equity investments, and business descriptions. However, none of these pages contain a direct line item for 'Operating margin' or its components (operating profit and revenue) specifically for the overall company.\n3. **Metric Matching:** The context includes revenue data for subsidiaries with non-controlling interests (pages 98 and 99) and segment revenue descriptions (page 73), but no operating profit figures. There is no consolidated income statement or statement of operations provided that would show operating profit and total revenue to calculate operating margin.\n4. **Value Extraction and Adjustment:** Since the necessary data (operating profit and total revenue) to calculate operating margin is not available in the context, no value can be extracted or calculated.\n5. **Confirmation:** The question requires the operating margin percentage, but the context lacks the required financial metrics. Therefore, the answer is 'N/A' as per the instruction to return 'N/A' if data is not available."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks whether TSX_Y announced a share buyback plan in the annual report. TSX_Y is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but the context refers to Yellow Pages Limited, which may be the company in question (possibly TSX_Y is a ticker symbol).\n2. The phrase 'share buyback plan' refers to a program or plan for repurchasing shares, such as a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) or a plan of arrangement.\n3. The context includes multiple references to share repurchases: on page 68, it describes NCIBs and a plan of arrangement for share repurchases; on page 20, it mentions a dividend policy but also references share repurchases; on page 19, it details NCIBs and a plan of arrangement; on page 39, it shows cash flows for repurchases; on page 22, it discusses cash uses including repurchases; on page 1 and 3, it mentions share repurchases as part of accomplishments; on page 71, it notes amendments to stock option plans related to repurchases.\n4. Specifically, on page 68, it states: 'The Company entered into a normal course issuer bid ('NCIB')...' and 'On August 4, 2022, the Board approved a distribution to shareholders of approximately $100.0 million by way of a share repurchase... pursuant to a statutory arrangement...' This indicates announcements of share buyback plans.\n5. The context is from the annual report for 2022, and these announcements are made within that report, confirming they were announced in the annual report.\n6. Therefore, based on the context, TSX_Y (Yellow Pages Limited) did announce share buyback plans, specifically NCIBs and a plan of arrangement, in the annual report."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks for the largest single spending of CrossFirst Bank on executive compensation in USD. This implies I need to find a specific dollar amount related to executive compensation, likely from the annual report.\n2. My source of information is the provided context from the annual report of CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. I will search through the text for any mentions of executive compensation, salaries, benefits, or related financial figures.\n3. From page 65, the Consolidated Statements of Operations include a line item for 'Salaries and employee benefits' under Non-Interest Expense, with amounts for 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, this is a general category and not specifically for executive compensation.\n4. From page 35, there is a section titled 'INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS' that lists executive officers but does not provide compensation figures.\n5. From page 113, there is a list of exhibits including employment agreements (e.g., with Mike Maddox, Benjamin R. Clouse, Amy Fauss, Randy Rapp, Steve Peterson, Jana D. Merfen), which might contain compensation details, but the context does not include the actual amounts from these agreements.\n6. From page 112, there is a description of the Omnibus Plan for stock-based compensation, but it does not specify dollar amounts for individual executive compensation.\n7. I do not see any specific dollar amounts for executive compensation in the provided context. The question may be referring to a particular compensation item such as a salary, bonus, or stock award, but without explicit figures in the text, I cannot determine the largest single spending.\n8. Since the context does not contain the necessary information to answer the question, I must conclude that the answer is not available in the provided pages."

The context includes multiple pages that discuss mergers and acquisitions.

Page 34 lists several acquisitions completed from 2020 through 2022, including Baer, Inc., Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., Advance Engine Management Inc., Simpson Performance Products, and Drake Automotive Group. Page 33 also mentions the business combination and its details.\n3. The mentions are explicit and detailed, covering both a significant merger and multiple acquisitions, indicating that the annual report does discuss these events.\n4. The question is straightforward and directly addressed by the provided context, with no ambiguity in the wording."
